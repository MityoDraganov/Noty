# Noty
A repository for 2nd round of #CODEWARS2023 (itpg Varna)

#Project concept:
Noty is a SPA Application based on React.js.
It's whole purpose is to allow users to use Note Groups (groups of notes, allowing CRUD operations) and to manage other users' access to them.
Each note is sorted into a Note Group allowing for a clean co-working environment that is user friendly.
Noty also allows users to use the application in a Guests mode, in which notes are managed into a single Guests Board that is stored only locally and doesn't allow adding co-workers

#Project requirments:
